This is the authenticator module for gematik sekoraler idp.

This app can be used to test login with GesundheitsID.

Application for android is found in this repository, for iOS it's located in TestFlight.
Note that building GSIA for yourself will result in a different fingerprint due to different signing keys, thus only the provided application works as intended.
