# GSIA Multiplatform App

This is the authenticator module for gematik sekoraler idp.  

In ./emulator/ we provide a scripts to create a plain android emulator with GSIA preinstalled on it.  
In addition within configureEmulator.sh you can enter location of your DiGA-apk which then will be 
installed also. Thus you can test the App-App-Flow manually on the emulator.
